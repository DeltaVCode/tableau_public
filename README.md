Files for students learning Tableau basics from DeltaV.

## Data Files

The files in the data folder are the example data files to be used when following the examples of the one-day Tableau training seminar. The files were created for the example. Only the census data is real. The sales data was fabricated for the example.

## Example Scenario

In the example, a ficticious company has noticed that some salespeople have much higher sales than others. The management wants to know why this is the case and if there is some knowledge that would help them increase sales for those who underperform. The goal is to use a Tableau visualization to understand the data and decide what to do next.
