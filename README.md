# tableau_public

Files for students learning Tableau basics from DeltaV.

## Data Files

The files in the data folder are the example data files to be used when following the examples of the one-day Tableau training seminar. The files were created for the example. Only the census data is real. The sales data was fabricated for the example.

## Example Scenario

In the example, a ficticious company has noticed that some salespeople have much higher sales than others. The management wants to know why this is the case and if there is some knowledge that would help them increase sales for those who underperform. The goal is to use a Tableau visualization to understand the data and decide what to do next.

## Getting the Files

There are two primary ways to download the files.

### Using git

If you are familiar with the git software, and have it installed, you can use the repository URL to clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeltaVCode/tableau_public.git
```

### Downloading a ZIP File

If you do not use git, you can download a zipped file containing the files. Above and to the right of the list of files is a green button labeled "Code". It has a small downward-pointing arrow after the name. Click on this button to show a context menu with options for retrieving the repository. The lowest one is "Download ZIP". Click this to download a zip file to your computer. It will save to the location where you normally save downloaded files. To use the files they will need to be unzipped.
